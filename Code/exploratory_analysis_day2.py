# We have day number, date, and active cases. We can use the day number and active cases to fit an exponential growth curve to estimate R0.
# Let's define the exponential growth function
def exponential_growth(t, r):

# Fit the exponential growth model to the data. 
# We'll use a handy function from scipy called CURVE_FIT that allows us to fit any given function to our data. 
# We will fit the exponential growth function to the active cases data. HINT: Look up the documentation for curve_fit to see how to use it.

# Approximate R0 using this fit

# Add the fit as a line on top of your scatterplot.
