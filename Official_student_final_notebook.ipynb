    "\n",
    "We then estimated $(R_0)$ using the Day 2 approximation $R_0 \\approx e^{rD}$, where $(D)$ is the infectious period. For $(D)$, we used the “New information about our mystery virus” statement that the symptomatic period is 5–9 days and individuals are infectious for 2 days before symptoms appear, giving $(D \\approx [7, 11])$ days.\n",
